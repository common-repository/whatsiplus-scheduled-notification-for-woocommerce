### WhatsApp Scheduled Notification WooCommerce ###

If you've worked with email marketing systems like MailerLite, you're likely familiar with automated or scheduled emails triggered after a product purchase. These emails are sent automatically after a user signs up on your site or makes a specific purchase, keeping customers engaged.

However, the problem arises because email is not always the most effective communication channel with users. Many people check their emails infrequently, and sometimes emails are opened long after your campaign has ended. In contrast, WhatsApp messages are checked instantly and daily, making it an ideal and fast way to connect with customers.

The main challenge is that developing this capability for a website can be costly. Website owners need to invest significantly to create a plugin that supports scheduled messages, similar to MailerLite‚Äôs scheduled email system, allowing for automated messages to be sent after a purchase. We address this issue by developing a powerful plugin that adds the ability to send scheduled WhatsApp messages to your site, enabling you to send as many timed WhatsApp messages to your customers as needed.
